Fix:



- Home Page:
  - Center act name display on circles
  - Menu determine content and links
  - Figure out layout of index page. What other content on there?
  - How can I make it so some acts show up then rest pop when click show all?

- Event Index page:
  - Make styling pretty
  - Make Schedule layout nicer/ more dynamic
  - See events by : date, venue, act

-Venues page layout
-Acts page layout


To do BackEnd :

- Set up User Profile(include gravatar)

- Feature: User can email schedule to someone

- Create a README

- Feature: User can add events to their schedule

Nov.23 :
 - Added action to favorite controller, need to grab info from from

In show.html.erb / users

<%=form_for(current_user, Favorite.new) do |f| %>
<%= f.hidden_field :event_id, :value => event.id %>
<% end %>

<%=form_for [@user, Favorite.new] do |f| %>
  <%= f.hidden_field :event_id, :value => event.id %>
  <%= f.submit 'Add to Favorites', class: "btn btn-default" %>
<% end %>

then you would grab user.id in the favorite new/create controller
