Fix:

- Home Page:

  - Menu determine content and links
  - Figure out layout of index page. What other content on there?


- Event Index page:
  - Make styling pretty
  - Make Schedule layout nicer/ more dynamic
  - See events by : date, venue, act



To do :

- Set up User Profile(include gravatar)
- Feature: User can add events to their schedule
- Feature: User can email schedule to someone

- Create a README


In show.html.erb / users

<%=form_for(current_user, Favorite.new) do |f| %>
<%= f.hidden_field :event_id, :value => event.id %>
<% end %>

then you would grab user.id in the favorite new/create controller
