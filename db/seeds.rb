  ["Ariel Pink", "American Electro-Folk", "Before Today was the band’s 4AD debut, offering the first sign that the intriguingly scatalogical music Ariel had been making for over a decade was finally ossifying into a coherent form. Indeed, the lead song from Before Today - the inimitable ‘Round and Round’ - was awarded Pitchfork’s track of the year for 2010, and further plaudits were heaped upon the long player as it cropped up in near-all end-of-year polls. For many it seemed that Ariel had finally reached the wider audience his early recordings had hinted was possible. And with Mature Themes, Haunted Graffiti have forged a record that raises the bar once again. Installing themselves in a studio space in downtown-LA, Haunted Graffiti began a lengthy process of writing and recording. Mature Themes is a self-produced affair, with former member Cole MGN drafted in to provide some drum programming and additional mixing duties. Far removed from Ariel’s early bedroom recordings, Mature Themes is a product of a more collaborative process, with the often-overlooked virtuoso musicianship of the band bought to the fore. We had time to let our hair down and try new things.", "http://4ad.com/artists/arielpink","http://icelandairwaves.is/artist-data/fullsize/362472.jpg","https://soundcloud.com/smileforme-3"],

  ["Beach House","American dream pop","BEACH HOUSE will release Depression Cherry, the band's fifth album, on 28th August on Bella Union. The album will be released in North America on Sub Pop Records and Mistletone in Australia and New Zealand. Depression Cherry was produced and recorded by the band and Chris Coady at Studio in the Country in Bogalusa, Louisiana. About Beach House: Beach House is Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally. We have been a band for over a decade living and working in Baltimore, MD. Depression Cherry is our 5th full-length record. This record follows the release of our self-titled album in 2006, Devotion in 2008, Teen Dream in 2010 and Bloom in 2012. Depression Cherry was recorded at Studio in the Country in Bogalusa, Louisiana from November ’14 through January ’15. This time period crossed the anniversaries of both John Lennon’s and Roy Orbison’s death.","http://www.beachhousebaltimore.com","http://icelandairwaves.is/artist-data/fullsize/352641.jpg","https://soundcloud.com/beachhouse"],

  ["Braids","Experimental Pop","Braids are a three-piece experimental pop band from Montreal. To record their third album, 'Deep In The Iris', Braids decamped to a series of retreats in the mountains of Arizona, Vermont, and upstate New York.  Surrounded by nature in all its warm vitality, the longtime bandmates strove to shed the fabric of their day to day relationships, being bare and vulnerable before one another.  What resulted is 'Deep In The Iris', their strongest record to date – powerful, yet fragile; immaculately sculpted, but deeply human. Driven by roomy acoustic instrumentation and tasteful electronics, 'Deep In The Iris' is easily Braids’ sunniest and most immediate record. While the icy, airless production of their second album 'Flourish // Perish' suited the songs' inward gaze, the widescreen warmth and full-bodied punch of 'Deep In The Iris' are the perfect complement to its unflinching lyricism.   Longtime friends, Braids was formed in 2007 in Calgary, AB.  After relocating to Montreal, the band released their critically acclaimed debut 'Native Speaker' in 2011, and its 2013 follow-up 'Flourish // Perish'.  Consisting of Raphaelle Standell, Austin Tufts, and Taylor Smith, Braids are a collaborative whole, emphasizing a collective creative experience.", "http://braidsmusic.com/","http://icelandairwaves.is/artist-data/fullsize/379184.jpg","https://soundcloud.com/braidsmusic/miniskirt"],

  ["Emilie & Ogden","Traditional Folk", "Emilie & Ogden is not your typical duet but rather an encounter between a young singer and a harp. Her particular voice has often been described as pure and soft, resonating in perfect harmony with the instrument. On stage, her traditional folk sound is embellished by drums, bass and a soft electronic touch, drawing inspiration from other female artists such as Feist and St-Vincent.","https://emilieandogden.com/","http://icelandairwaves.is/artist-data/fullsize/388826.jpg","https://soundcloud.com/secretcityrecords/emilie-ogden-what-happened" ],

  ["FM Belfast","Icelandic Folk-Electro", "The President of Iceland, Mr. Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, often speaks of the special nature of the Icelandic people. In his mind, the most treasured commodity among Icelanders is their “Viking” spirit—their passion and enthusiasm for conquering new ground and reaping the benefits of their adventurous and courageous natures. This is obviously a load of nonsense and has absolutely nothing to do with FM Belfast. FM Belfast just want to be your friend. Because FM Belfast are not Vikings. They do not pillage and plunder. Instead, they give, and they care. With simple, delicately crafted melodies, unpredictable beats and humorous lyrics, FM Belfast bring smiles to their audience’s faces, and life to their every extremity—whether it be in the car, in the kitchen or on the dancefloor. But there’s more. In their live performances, FM Belfast somehow manage to elevate their music to new heights. They manage to mediate a certain weltanschauung; manage to share their joie de vivre. Seeing an FM Belfast concert is almost a religous experience, save for the religion. Unlike organized religion, though, their music isn’t conditional—it is simply inviting. It offers a genuine sense of belonging. Everyone feels it, as they dance and chant and release more sweat than Jane Fonda’s disciples ever could. FM Belfast was originally formed by couple Lóa Hjálmtýsdóttir and Árni Hlöðversson in late 2005. They wanted to record a song, one which they could give to their friends as a Christmas present. Says a lot, doesn’t it? Not surprisingly, the Iceland Airwaves music festival proved to be a catalyst in the band’s story—as Lóa and Árni needed extra people for their live act in 2006. These extra people have been numerous, although the core members have included Árni Vilhjálmsson (Motherfuckers in the House), Örvar Þóreyjarson Smárason (Múm). Andri Snær Magnason, three-time recipient of the Icelandic Literary Prize, says he has to attend a FM Belfast concert at least once every six months, according to doctor's orders. It is worth mentioning that Andri Snær is not a doctor, but his father is a doctor; his grandfather is a doctor; his sister is no less than a neurosurgeon! Should we, the common, soot-stained masses, doubt the professional medical advice of an entire family? Thankfully we don't have to. Because FM Belfast takes its role in the public's health very seriously. Because the members of the band are just like you and me—they are a part of us. They pay off their mortgages, take their kids to day care and in the evening boil potatoes. They don't always have enough to fill the gas tank or perhaps don't even have a car to begin with. They've even been known to play basketball in tattered sneakers. The band's struggle for survival, and that of the Icelandic nation as a whole, is wearisome and tedious. But in the end, there is good news, because FM Belfast knows the antidote—the recipe for making the struggle a happy one and for patching the holes in tattered sneakers.","https://www.fmbelfast.com/", "http://icelandairwaves.is/artist-data/fullsize/389298.jpg", "https://soundcloud.com/fmbelfast/brighter-days" ],

  ["Júníus Meyvant","Icelandic Folk","Júníus Meyvant is the artist name of Vestmann Islands born singer-songwriter Unnar Gísli Sigurmundsson. As a young boy he was an eccentric to a small degree and he only loved two things, skateboarding and painting. Every now and then he asked the Muses if he should learn to play an instrument but his wild and free behavior terminated his dreams as he was quickly suspended from music school. All through his teens he rambled on without even considering becoming a musician or even playing any instruments. In his early twenties Unnar stumbled upon a beat up guitar at his parents’ house and started noodling around. By playing the guitar he managed to tame his inner beast and his sense for songs and melodies burst like rockets. The uncontrollable urge for writing music and constant flow of ideas kept him tossing and turning every night and day forever and a day. For a while he filtered his ideas through a band that didn’t live up to his creative requirements so he decided to undertake his alter ego Júníus Meyvant. The sound of Júníus Meyvant is a rich and afflicted take on freaky folk pop with a familiar and soulful feel. The feeling you get from listening to Júníus is equally as comfortable as resting under a thick wool blanket with a hot cup of cocoa or even when one settles with an exotic beverage on a hot sandy beach far and away.", "http://www.juniusmeyvant.com/","http://icelandairwaves.is/artist-data/fullsize/362509.jpg","https://soundcloud.com/recordrecords/junius-meyvant-color-decay"],

  ["Kiasmos", "Electronic", "Kiasmos is made up of Icelandic BAFTA-winning composer Ólafur Arnalds, known for his unique blend of minimal piano and string compositions with electronic sounds, and Janus Rasmussen from the Faroe Islands, known as the mastermind of the electro-pop outfit Bloodgroup. Based in Reykjavík, Arnalds used to work as a sound engineer, often for Rasmussen's other projects, where the two musicians discovered their common love for minimal, experimental music. They eventually became best friends, often hanging out in their studio, exploring electronic sounds. After dropping several tracks and performing at select festivals throughout the years, Ólafur Arnalds and Janus Rasmussen are now dedicating their time to exploring the area in-between Ólafur’s more acoustic, piano-based solo work and Janus’s synth-heavy electro pop, with their collaborative electronic project Kiasmos.","http://www.erasedtapes.com/artists/biography/11/kiasmos", "http://icelandairwaves.is/artist-data/fullsize/395238.jpg", "https://soundcloud.com/erasedtapes/kiasmos-bent" ]
